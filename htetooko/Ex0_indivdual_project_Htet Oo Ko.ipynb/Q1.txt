I love this movie! It is sweet, but with satirical humor. The dialogs are great and the adventure scenes are fun. It manages to be romantic and whimsical while laughingat the conventions of the fairy tale genre. I would recommend it to just about anyone. I have seen it several times and I am always happy to see it again and again.
